How to Play:

Be the fastest to complete a maze and make it to the other side! Navigate through the fences and cross the finish line in the shortest amount of time to set a high score and make it onto the leaderboard!

Use the following keys on your computer to move around:

W - move up
A - move left
S - move down
D - move right

You can see your current run time on the top left of the screen which will stop once you exit the maze on the opposite side.

Think outside the box to be the fastest!
Good luck!
